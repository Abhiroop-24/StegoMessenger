# StegoMessenger

StegoMessenger is a secure messaging application that uses steganography to hide messages within image files. It enables users to send encrypted messages by embedding them in images, ensuring both confidentiality and security. 

## Features

- **Message Encryption:** StegoMessenger encrypts messages before embedding them in images, ensuring that the contents remain private.
